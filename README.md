# KNN-algorithm-using-OpenGL
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm classifies data points based on the majority label of their k nearest neighbors. In OpenGL, you could visualize KNN by rendering data points in 3D space and highlighting the nearest neighbors with lines or different colors.       4o
